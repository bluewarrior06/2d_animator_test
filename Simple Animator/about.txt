What is this project about? I have always loved generative art. And no, I'm not talking about
AI generated art, I'm talking about art created and instructed through fully planned out
logic. It's akin to something you may see in a demoscene, where someone will just
make some weird shit because it looks cool as fuck. This project is no different!

Each separate animation is inside of a "scene", which holds it's own logic for during
playback. Each scene can have multiple different objects that can move around 
on screen.

Scene ideas -
[ ] - Rain falling in different directions.
[ ] - Kid jumping in puddles.
[ ] - Rain world "semi-simulation".
(there is an obvious WET theme going on right now...)
[ ] - Magma pools popping and releasing magma.
[ ] - A bunch of drying clothes flapping in the wind.
